<h2>About Us:</h2>
<p>We highschoolers have come together to create a non profit business with goal of teaching computer science through a neurological standpoint and also using other bio related topics. We also collaborate with professors to conduct research projects. We are currently making networks with multiple schools to start up clubs where Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and neural networks would be taught. Our LinkedIn page can be found <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/neuro-coding/ target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<h2>How We Help:</h2>
<p>Our main goal here at Neuro Coding is to be able to educate others about computer science from a neurological standpoint and also using other biology related topics. We also collaborate with professors to work on research projects. We try our best to expand our network to multiple schools so we can start up clubs that give students understanding of Artificial Intelligence and neural networks while also providing research opportunities.</p>
